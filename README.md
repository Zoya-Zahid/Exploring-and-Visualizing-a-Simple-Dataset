Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset  
Developed By:Zoya Zahid

This project demonstrates the process of loading, inspecting, and visualizing the classic Iris dataset to uncover trends, relationships, and distributions using Python.
---
Task Objective
To explore the Iris dataset using basic data analysis and visualization techniques and understand how features like sepal and petal dimensions relate to different species.

---
Dataset Used
- Name:Iris Dataset  
- Source: `iris.csv` (downloaded) or seaborn built-in dataset  
- Shape: 150 rows × 5 columns (4 numeric features, 1 target label)

---
Models Applied
- No machine learning model applied — this task focused purely on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using:
  - Scatter Plots
  - Histograms
  - KDE Curves
  - Box Plots

---
Key Results and Findings

- Petal dimensions clearly differentiate species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
- Scatter plots and pairplots showed strong feature relationships.
- Box plots highlighted outliers and distribution ranges.
- Histograms with KDE showed the spread and central tendency of each feature.
- Dataset was clean, with no missing values.

Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
